<p>The architecture of the proposed classroom slide segmentation network for classroom slide segmentation. The network consists of three modules --- (i) attention module (upper dotted region), (ii) multi-scale feature extraction module (lower  region), (iii) feature concatenation module. Here, <sub>&oplus</sub> and $\otimes$ represent the element-wise summation and multiplication of features, respectively.
